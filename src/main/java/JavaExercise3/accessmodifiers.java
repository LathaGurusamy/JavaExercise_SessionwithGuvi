		 * 
		 //What are the four access modifiers available in Java and what is their significance in terms of class,method,
		 //and variable accessibility?
		 
		 
		  Public: 
		  =======
		  The public access modifier makes a class, method, or variable accessible from any other class. 
		  If a class, method, or variable is declared as public, it can be accessed from any other class in the same package or from any other package.
		 
        public class MyClass {
    public int myVariable;
    
    public void myMethod() {
        // Method code here
    }
}
==================================
Protected:
============
 The protected access modifier makes a class, method, or variable accessible within its own package and by subclasses,
  even if they are in a different package. It allows for a more restricted access compared to public.
  
  protected class MyClass {
    protected int myVariable;
    
    protected void myMethod() {
        // Method code here
    }
}
=======================================
  Default (Package-Private):
  =========================
   If no access modifier is specified, it is considered as default (sometimes referred to as package-private). Classes, methods, or variables with default access are accessible only within the same package. They are not accessible from outside the package.

class MyClass {
    int myVariable; // default access
    
    void myMethod() { // default access
        // Method code here
    }
}
==========================================
Private: 
========
The private access modifier makes a class, method, or variable accessible only within the same class. 
It provides the most restrictive access. Private members are not visible outside the class, even to subclasses.
public class MyClass {
    private int myVariable;
    
    private void myMethod() {
        // Method code here
    }
}

================================================
 lower to higher visibility:
 ============================
increasing visibility and accessibility of members:private to default to protected to public.
